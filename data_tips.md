# Data Collection and Management

Data collection and management is the most important part of the research process. 
Below is a minimum set of rules you should follow:

## Tidy data
Your dataset should look **[tidy]([url](https://openscapes.org/blog/2020-10-12-tidy-data/))**

![tidy-data](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/081ba1fc-e5df-48e5-a095-6182167ae316)

**Why?**
Tidy data allows you to be more efficient by using existing tools deliberately built to do the things you need to do,

Tidy data makes it easier to collaborate

Tidy data also makes it easier to reproduce analyses because they are easier to understand, update, and reuse.

## Basics of Research Data Management: Tabular Data (Spreadsheets)

1. **Separate the data entry phase from the data analysis phase**  
   - **Wrong**: Enter the data in Excel and use Excel for analysis.  
   - **Right**:  
     - Create a form, such as Google Forms, for data entry.  
     - Export the data for analysis using tools like:
       - [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/) or [JAMOVI](https://www.jamovi.org/) for basic data analysis.  
       - [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for advanced analysis or creating visualizations.

1. **Original Data**  
   - Ensure the original data is preserved and stored separately from processed data.
   - DO NOT TOUCH THE ORIGINAL DATA!

1. **Rows and Columns**  
   - Rows are for observations.  
   - Columns are for variables.  
   - Keep the **data type** the same within a column:  
     - Numbers: Distinguish between integers and decimals.  
     - Text: Ensure uniform formatting.  
   - Avoid having more than one table per spreadsheet.  

1. **Be Consistent**  
   - Use consistent codes for categorical variables.  
   - Use a fixed, consistent code for missing values.  
   - Use consistent subject identifiers.  
   - Use consistent date formatting.  

1. **No Empty Cells**  
   - If data is missing, explicitly encode it as missing (e.g., use `NA` or another agreed-upon value).  
   - Avoid headers with more than one row.
   - BAD:

   - GOOD:

1. **Choose Good Names for Things**  
   - **Variable Names**:  
     - Avoid spaces and avoid starting with numbers.  
     - **Do**: Use numbers and letters.  
     - **Avoid**Special characters and symbols.  
     - **Do**: Use underscores (`_`) instead of spaces.  
   - Use both an **internal column name** and a **displayed name**:  
     - Example: Internal column name `max_temp`, displayed name `Maximum Temp (Â°C)`.

1. **Put Just One Thing in a Cell**  
   - Avoid combining multiple columns into a single column.  
   - Avoid placing multiple bits of information in a single cell.

1. **Write Dates as YYYY-MM-DD**  
    - Avoid formats like DD-MM-YYYY, which can lead to inconsistencies.
    - Convert `YYYY-MM-DD` to text to preserve formatting when loading data.  
    - Alternatively, store dates as an integer in the format `YYYYMMDD`.
