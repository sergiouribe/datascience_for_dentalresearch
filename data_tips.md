Data collection and management is the most important part of the research process. Below is a minimum set of rules you should follow:

## Basics of Research Data Management: Tabular Data (Spreadsheets)

1. **Separate the data entry phase from the data analysis phase**  
   - **Wrong**: Enter the data in Excel and use Excel for analysis.  
   - **Right**:  
     - Create a form, such as Google Forms, for data entry.  
     - Export the data for analysis using tools like:
       - [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/) or [JAMOVI](https://www.jamovi.org/) for basic data analysis.  
       - [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for advanced analysis or creating visualizations.

1. **Original Data**  
   - Ensure the original data is preserved and stored separately from processed data.
   - DO NOT TOUCH THE ORIGINAL DATA!

1. **Rows and Columns**  
   - Rows are for observations.  
   - Columns are for variables.  
   - Keep the **data type** the same within a column:  
     - Numbers: Distinguish between integers and decimals.  
     - Text: Ensure uniform formatting.  
   - Avoid having more than one table per spreadsheet.  

1. **Be Consistent**  
   - Use consistent codes for categorical variables.  
   - Use a fixed, consistent code for missing values.  
   - Use consistent subject identifiers.  
   - Use consistent date formatting.  

1. **No Empty Cells**  
   - If data is missing, explicitly encode it as missing (e.g., use `NA` or another agreed-upon value).  
   - Avoid headers with more than one row.
   - BAD:

   - GOOD:

1. **Choose Good Names for Things**  
   - **Variable Names**:  
     - Avoid spaces and avoid starting with numbers.  
     - **Do**: Use numbers and letters.  
     - **Avoid**: Special characters and symbols.  
     - **Do**: Use underscores (`_`) instead of spaces.  
   - Use both an **internal column name** and a **displayed name**:  
     - Example: Internal column name `max_temp`, displayed name `Maximum Temp (Â°C)`.

1. **Put Just One Thing in a Cell**  
   - Avoid combining multiple columns into a single column.  
   - Avoid placing multiple bits of information in a single cell.

1. **Write Dates as YYYY-MM-DD**  
    - Avoid formats like DD-MM-YYYY, which can lead to inconsistencies.  
    - When loading data, convert `YYYY-MM-DD` to text to preserve formatting.  
    - Alternatively, store dates as an integer in the format `YYYYMMDD`.
